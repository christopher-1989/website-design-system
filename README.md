# Website Design System

## Introduction

This project is intended for the creator to be able to store/showcase the basic design styles that would commonly be used when creating a website.

## Boilerplate HTML

A boilerplate-html file has been included. To view the contents of the file either load it directly from the repository or when on the home page of the website design system, click on the "Boilerplate HTML" button.

## June 2021 update

The layout of the website design system has been updated to include flexbox meaning that the page is more responsive and consistent than previous versions.

A store of the templates has been created in main.js allowing for future additions or revisions to be greatly simplified. Each of the 'cards' for each of the three sections: colours, fonts, and font sizes are rendered from the main.js file. 

## Further information

This project will be continually updated with design principles that are commonly used or are very effective.
